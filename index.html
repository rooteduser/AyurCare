                    <h1>What is Ayurveda?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Ayurveda is a whole-body (holistic) system of medicine that began in India more than 3,000 years
                        ago.
                        Ayurveda means the study of life. It takes a natural approach to all aspects of health and
                        well-being.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ayurveda is based on the idea that each person has certain life forces (doshas) and everything
                        in
                        the
                        universe is connected. An imbalance in 1 area can affect another. When the imbalance is not
                        fixed,
                        disease and illness can occur. Ayurveda mostly uses nutrition, lifestyle changes, and natural
                        treatments. These are used to support balance and a return to health. Ayurveda is very focused
                        on
                        overall health. But it may use specific treatments for some diseases</p>

                    <h1>Ayurvedic providers</h1>

                    <p>
                        In India, Ayurveda is a regular medical system. It's practiced in the same way that standard
                        medicine is
                        used in the U.S.</p>
                    <p>
                        Ayurveda providers in India must go through detailed, state-approved education and training
                        before
                        they
                        can
                        practice medicine.</p>

                    <p>
                        Before you choose an Ayurvedic provider, be sure to check the provider's training and
                        background. At
                        this
                        time, Ayurvedic providers are not licensed in the U.S. The U.S. does not have a national
                        standard
                        for
                        Ayurvedic training or certification. But a few states have approved Ayurvedic schools.</p>

                    <h1>Is it safe?</h1>

                    <p>
                        Ayurveda has not been fully studied from a U.S. view. Ayurvedic medicines are regulated as
                        dietary
                        supplements in the U.S. They are not regulated as medicines. This means they don't need to meet
                        the
                        safety standards as medicines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some Ayurvedic medicines have herbs, metals, minerals, and other materials. Some of these may be
                        harmful
                        if not used safely. Some Ayurvedic medicines may have toxic materials. These can include lead,
                        arsenic,
                        and mercury. Any herb, mineral, or metal used in this type of treatment may work against
                        standard
                        medicines or other supplements you have been prescribed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's important to talk with your healthcare provider before using any Ayurvedic treatment. This
                        is
                        even
                        more important if you:</p>
